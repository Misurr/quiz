# quiz
This is the quiz app that I created for the course I attended. It allows users to add, edit, and delete areas, as well as create and manage both single and multiple-choice questions. True/false and connecting questions CRUD functionalities are still pending. Additionally, users can play the quiz at the end. Backend was made by other team members.
